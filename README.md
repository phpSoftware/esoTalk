esoTalk is a free, open-source forum software package built with PHP and MySQL. It is designed to be:

 - **Fast.** esoTalk's code was architectured to have little overhead and to be as efficient as possible.
 - **Simple.** All of esoTalk's interfaces are designed around simplicity, ease-of-use, and speed.
 - **Powerful.** Despite its simplicity, a large array of [plugins](https://github.com/phpSoftware/esoTalk-2020/tree/master/addons/plugins) and [skins](https://github.com/phpSoftware/esoTalk-2020/tree/master/addons/skins) are available to extend the functionality of esoTalk.

esoTalk is developed by Toby Zerner in memory of his brother, Simon.
