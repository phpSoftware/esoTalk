esoTalk: German language pack
=============================

## About esoTalk

esoTalk is a _fat-free forum software_ developed by [@tobscure](https://twitter.com/tobscure) - and it's great. It is currently available in version 1.0.0g.

## About the language pack

There already had bin a [german language pack](https://github.com/mic-git/esoTalk-german-translation) but it had been discontinued and is outdated now (it partly still works, though). So I decided to translate my own.

## About the use of words

There will be no harsh language in the translations. Despite the fact that German words and sentences are often longer than English ones, I will try to translate _to the point_ without loss the meaning.
