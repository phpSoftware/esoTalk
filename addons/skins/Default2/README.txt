# esoTalk Default2 skin
This is a slightly modified Default skin for the esoTalk forum software.

The skin has the same look as the original Default skin of esoTalk version 1.0.0g4. It just replaces the avatar and username of the latest replier to those of the originator of the conversation.

The skin is prepared to show channel colors. If you want colors, remove 2 lines in the file resources/styles.css where it says "remove line for channel colors".

How to install

1. Upload to your forums directory addons/skins
2. Rename skin folder to Default2
